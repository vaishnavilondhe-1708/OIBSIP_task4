# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, demonstrating a real-world application of machine learning in viticulture.

## Dataset
The dataset contains chemical attributes such as acidity, density, pH, and alcohol content, which are used as input features for prediction.

## Approach
- Data analysis and visualization
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Wine quality prediction using Random Forest, SGD, and SVC classifiers

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
The project compares multiple machine learning classifiers to predict wine quality and identify the most effective model.
